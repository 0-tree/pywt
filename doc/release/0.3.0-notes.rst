PyWavelets 0.3.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. contents::

PyWavelets 0.3.0 is the first release of the package in 3 years.  It is the
result of a significant effort of a growing development team to modernize the
package, to provide Python 3.x support and to make a start with providing new
features as well as improved performance.  A 0.4.0 release will follow
shortly, and will contain more significant new features as well as
changes/deprecations to streamline the API.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3-3.5 and NumPy 1.6.2 or greater.

Highlights of this release include:

- Support for Python 3.x (>=3.3)
- Added a test suite (based on nose, coverage up to 61% so far)
- Maintenance work: C style complying to the Numpy style guide, improved
  templating system, more complete docstrings, pep8/pyflakes compliance, and
  more.


New features
============

Test suite
----------

The test suite can be run with ``nosetests pywt`` or with::

    >>> import pywt
    >>> pywt.test()

n-D Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform
--------------------------------------

The function ``pywt.idwtn``, which provides n-dimensional inverse DWT, has been
added.  It complements ``idwt``, ``idwt2`` and ``dwtn``.

Thresholding
------------

The function `pywt.threshold` has been added.  It unifies the four thresholding
functions that are still provided in the ``pywt.thresholding`` namespace.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

None in this release.


Other changes
=============

Development has moved to `a new repo <https://github.com/rgommers/pywt>`_.
Everyone with an interest in wavelets is welcome to contribute!

Building wheels, building with ``python setup.py develop`` and many other
standard ways to build and install PyWavelets are supported now.

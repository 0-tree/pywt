New features

Deprecated features
===================


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

``idwt`` no longer takes a ``correct_length`` parameter. As a consequence,
``idwt2`` inputs must match exactly in length. For multilevel transforms, where
arrays differing in size by one element may be produced, use the ``waverec``
functions from the ``multilevel`` module instead.

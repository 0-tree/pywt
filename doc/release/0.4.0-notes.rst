==============================
PyWavelets 0.4.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. note:: PyWavelets 0.4.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::



This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3-3.5 and NumPy 1.6.2 or greater.


New features
============


Deprecated features
===================

A number of functions have been renamed, the old names are deprecated and will
be removed in a future release:

- ``intwave``, renamed to ``integrate_wavelet``
- ``centrfrq``, renamed to ``central_frequency``
- ``scal2frq``, renamed to ``scale2frequency``
- ``orthfilt``, renamed to ``orthogonal_filter_bank``

Integration of general signals (i.e. not wavelets) with ``integrate_wavelet``
is deprecated.

The ``MODES`` object and its attributes are deprecated.  The new name is
``Modes``, and the attribute names are expanded:

- ``zpd``, renamed to ``zero``
- ``cpd``, renamed to ``constant``
- ``sp1``, renamed to ``smooth``
- ``sym``, renamed to ``symmetric``
- ``ppd``, renamed to ``periodic``
- ``per``, renamed to ``periodization``

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

``idwt`` no longer takes a ``correct_length`` parameter. As a consequence,
``idwt2`` inputs must match exactly in length. For multilevel transforms, where
arrays differing in size by one element may be produced, use the ``waverec``
functions from the ``multilevel`` module instead.
